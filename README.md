# Pokemon_Go

This project analyzes the "pokemon_go" dataset from OpenIntro ([link here](https://openintro.org/data/index.php?data=pokemon_go)), which has CP, HP, stardust, size/weight, and attack data for four types of Pokemon: Pidgey, Weedle, Caterpie, and Eevee. I used ggplot, linear and multiple regression (lm), and data cleaning (filter, mutate, etc.) to supplement statistical techniques. I aimed to answer the question: What are the most reliable and significant predictors of high post-evolution CP in Pokemon GO? I found that for Pidgey, pre-evolution CP, HP, stardust-power-up, and pre-evolution strong attack type were the most significant predictors. Caterpie and Weedle had similar results, with Eevee's linear model being ineffective due to scarcity of data on her species.
